The course "Programming Basics" teaches basic programming skills, required for all the educational paths in the Software University. This includes writing programming code using C# programming language (basic coding skills), working with Visual Studio - Integrated Development Environment (IDE), using variables and data, operators and expressions, working with the console (reading input data and printing results), using conditional statements (if, if-else) and loops (for and while). The course ends with a practical programming exam, which is also an entry exam for the Software Engineering educational program in the Software University.
